<p>Banitsa is a very popular dish in Bulgaria, there are many ways to make it and variations in ingredients. My recipe is simple and has always came out great.</p>

<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>16 sheets phyllo dough, thawed</li>
    <li>2 cups feta cheese</li>
    <li> 3 large eggs</li>
    <li> 1 tps salt</li>
    <li> 3/4 cup pf butter</li>
    <li> 1 cup milk</li>
</ul>

<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees, ( glass pyrex pan works great for this recipe) brush melted butter all over bottom amd sides of baking pan.</li>
    <li>Mix salt, cheese and milk and eggsin a bowl , combine and stir ingredients well.</li>
    <li>Put down 5 sheets of phyllo dough down in buttered pan and brush over with melted butter. You can also put down one sheet at a time and butter seperatelly.</li>

    <li>Pour enough of the mixture to cover phyllo sheets and top with 3 more sheets.</li>
    <li>Continue to repeat the process: put down 3 sheets and make sure to brush them well with butter then layer with mixture until all of the mixture is done, then cover with atleast 2 sheets.
         I preffer not to butter the top sheets as they tend to get very hard after the banitsa is done baking.</li> 
    <li>Bake for 25-35 minutes or until golden, make sure mixture is cooked in the middle by cutting into banitsa. When the mixture is cooked it will not be runny.</li>     
    <li>Once banitsa is done cover it with either a towell or the lid to the pan and let it sit and cool before cutting it or serving.
         Covering it lets the steam soften the phyllo dough sheets.</li>
